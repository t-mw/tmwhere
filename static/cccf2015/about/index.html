    <div class="body">
      <p>CCCF, Creative &amp; Cultural Careers Festival, is a weeklong festival of events organised by the <a href="http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/careers">University of Edinburgh Careers Service</a>. The Festival is aimed at students of all levels, as well as recent graduates, from any  subject who are interested in finding out more about working in the Creative Industries, Media or Cultural institutions. Through the events, we have tried to cover as many different sectors, industries, professions and crafts as possible in one week. Have a read through the event pages to find out what’s happening at each event and how to get involved. There’s also information on the speakers and organisations who will be delivering the sessions. </p>

<p>This is your chance to hear what life is like working in the Creative and Cultural Sectors, make vital contacts with industry professionals and to find out more about employment opportunities. </p>
