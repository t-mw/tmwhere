Within a week of his win he was out in Belfast working as an editor on CBBC’s The Sparticle Mystery. Working in Belfast’s busiest and biggest Post Production house, Conor was cutting episodes of Series 3 whilst shows like Game of Thrones and The Fall were being assembled next door. As well as his 4 edited episodes, Conor was asked to assemble the show’s trailer plus various behind the scenes content including deleted scenes, outtakes and interviews. Series One and Two amassed 2 million iPlayer hits and Series 3 is breaking new records for the channel. The success of the show has opened new doors for Conor and he has been in discussion with numerous execs and producers about going on to edit their own CBBC shows.</p>
